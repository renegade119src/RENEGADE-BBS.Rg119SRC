It's just like regular bowling, only the lanes:are carpet instead of wood.  I don't know why we should do,this, but my God, we've got to try something7Isn't it funny how whenever we go to a county fair or a:state fair, the first thing we do is see if they have somekind of pornography booth.:People laugh when I say that I think a jellyfish is one of8the most beautiful things in the world.

But also,check out his Adam's apple8I think one way police departments could make some money=would be to hold a yard sale of murder weapons.

In the first stage,;he is young and eager, like a beaver.  In the second stage,8he wants to build things, like dams, and maybe chew down;some trees.

Then we tell them to come9back in twenty years to see our real civilization.  After6that, we start a crash program of coming up with a new<civilization.  Either that, or just shoot down the aliens asthey're waving good-bye.<Like jewels in a crown, the precious stones glittered in thequeen's round metal hat.<I wish I could shrink down to the size of an ant.  And maybe9there would be thousands of other people shrunken down to8ant-size, and we would get together and dig tunnels down8into the ground, and live there.
