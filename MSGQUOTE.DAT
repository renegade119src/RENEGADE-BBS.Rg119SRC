0Love: a temporary insanity, curable by marriage.@He that hath a wife and children hath given hostages to fortune.7Never trust a husband too far, nor a bachelor too near.:All weddings are similar, but every marriage is different.-Marriage is our last, best chance to grow up.<I first learned the concepts of non-violence in my marriage.9Marriage is the triumph of imagination over intelligence.BThe goal in marriage is not to think alike, but to think together.0Marriage is the triumph of hope over experience.
